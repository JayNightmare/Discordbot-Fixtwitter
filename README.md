# Discordbot-Fixtwitter
Discord bot for change urls and other things.

# How works
to delete messages you must write "+N [number]" and choose the number of messages to delete.\
In the case of links, it is not necessary to do anything once you send a twitter or pixiv link, the bot will delete your message and send a new one with the fixed link.
